# Skill-Up (Social-media Clone and Real-time Chat application)

In this project I have build a interactive Social media web-application using Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend(node.js). 

This application lets you to customized your GUI like font-size, theam, Dark and Light mode and also you can chat with your connections which is built based on socket.io

socket.io : Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.
The Socket.IO connection can be established with different low-level transports:

HTTP long-polling\
WebSocket\
WebTransport


## To start

Run the code on any IDE and to use the real-time chat application run the following command 
## Deployment

First install node.js framwork and check if its install or not !

```bash
  node -v
```
Run the following command to install socket.io
```bash
  npm install socket.io
```
To install nodemon
```bash
  npm install nodemon
```
#### After running the code in an VScode (IDE) you can try the chat option. To get real-time responce in the chat-application start the node server.

  nodemon .\index.js
```
